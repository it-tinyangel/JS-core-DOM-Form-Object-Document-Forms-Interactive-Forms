### Interactive Forms

This task implements two interactive forms:

- **Task Move** — _**Copy Text Between Inputs**_ — with two text fields and a button, when the button is pressed, the content of the first field is automatically copied to the second field.

- **Task Placeholder** — _**Set Placeholder from Input Value**_ — this form allows you to enter text in the input field and when focus is lost, the entered text is automatically set as a placeholder value.
